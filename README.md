# phastebin.py
A script that transforms your clipboard into a pastebin or hastebin link
It also provides the option to get the content of the link to your clipboard.

## Requires:  
pip install pyperclip  
autohotkey

## Getting started:  
1.Get your autohotkey script running.  
(if you prefer to use hastebin, you need to edit the script to comment out pastebin)  
2.If you use pastebin, just follow the instructions the first time you use the script.  

### Windows:  
You can also add the AHK script to your startup. To do that, run ([WIN] + R) `shell:startup` and create a shortcut to your ahk in that folder.

If everything is set up, you can:  
1.[CTRL] + C - Copy your text/code to clipboard  
2.[CTRL] + [SHIFT] + C - Transform your text/code into the link  
3.[CTRL] + V - Paste the link to the person you want to share your text with.  

1.[CTRL] + C - Copy the hastebin/pastebin link to your clipboard  
2.[CTRL] + [SHIFT] + V - Transform your link into text/code  
3.[CTRL] + V - Copy the text/code to target location  


## Contribute:  
I am always open for programmers who want to revise my code, add new features etc.  
Experiencing uncaught bugs? A feature you are missing? Some other paste website you want to add? Use the issues page for that!  
Feel free to improve THIS readme as well!
With potential new websites to support, `phastebin` might not be a good name for the future. If you are creative, I would be happy to hear your idea for a name.
